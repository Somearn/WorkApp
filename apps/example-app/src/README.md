# Source Code

Place your application source code in this directory.

## Organization

Organize your code in a logical structure:

```
src/
├── main.py         # Main entry point (example)
├── utils/          # Utility modules
├── models/         # Data models
└── ...             # Other modules
```

This is just an example - organize your code in a way that makes sense for your application.
