Here’s a more detailed Theme Guidelines draft to ensure Copilot fully understands the design elements and implementation requirements. The descriptions are enhanced with added precision and context:

Enhanced Theme Guidelines
Background
Utilize a near-black deep-space theme, with subtle gradients or texture resembling a star-filled night sky.
Consider incorporating dim star clusters, faint nebula effects, or soft light flares to reinforce the starship cockpit ambiance.
Ensure the background remains subtle and non-distracting for foreground UI elements to stand out.
Panels
Design panels with rounded capsule-style shapes for a futuristic and ergonomic appearance.
Apply a 10-25% translucent black glass effect, allowing partial visibility of the background while maintaining focus on panel content.
Include subtle border highlights, such as thin silver or teal outlines, for panel edges to enhance visibility against dark backgrounds.
Incorporate light reflections or soft gradient overlays with direction-based lighting to simulate depth.
Actions
Use teal glow accents for primary buttons and actionable elements (e.g., Submit, Search).
Apply hover effects that slightly increase glow intensity and opacity to show interactivity.
Highlight stale or urgent items (e.g., errors, expired entries) with red accents:
Red Glow: Apply faint pulses to draw attention to urgent items.
Red Panels: Add contrasting red tones for warnings while maintaining readability.
Fonts
For general text: Implement modern sans-serif fonts optimized for readability and a clean, futuristic aesthetic (e.g., Open Sans, Roboto, or Inter).
For script viewer sections: Use monospace fonts (e.g., Consolas or Source Code Pro) to mimic terminal-like environments and ensure legibility of CMD/PowerShell scripts.
Apply contrast ratios that prioritize readability, e.g., white/near-white text (#F0F0F0) on near-black backgrounds.
Layout
Design the interface with a desktop-first layout optimized for 16:9 resolution screens at 1920x1080 (1080p).
Ensure elements are positioned to minimize clutter while promoting clear navigation paths:
Include fixed-width panels to maintain consistency across screen sizes.
Utilize central viewing angles for cockpit-style realism (e.g., dashboard information visible at a glance).
Incorporate responsive padding and margins for adequate spacing between panels and elements.
Additional Enhancements
Interactive Visual Feedback:

Add subtle animations (e.g., glowing transitions) for button presses and dynamic hover states.
Panels should respond to user actions with smooth opacity shifts or glowing highlights.
HUD Integration:

Include optional futuristic HUD overlays, such as targeting grids, faint status indicators, or positional data panels.
Color Palette Guidelines:

Neutral colors: Near-black (#0F0F0F), dark gray (#212121).
Accent colors: Teal (#00B2FF) for actions, red (#FF5733) for urgent states.
Secondary colors: Silver (#C0C0C0) for text outlines and subtle highlights.
