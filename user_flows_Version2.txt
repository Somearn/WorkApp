User Flows

Operator Flows
Operators interact with the app in a read-only mode, focusing on efficient triage and retrieval of information. The following tasks define their workflow:

Access Read-Only Records:

View site information, contact data, troubleshooting guides, and scripts in a unified, centralized interface.
All records are defaulted to read-only mode, ensuring operators cannot modify data.
Global Search & Power Filters:

Perform quick searches across all records using intuitive filters such as:
type:<site/phone/node>: Filter records by data type.
tag:<value>: Search based on applied metadata tags.
supports:<value>: Locate records supporting a particular category or query.
Copy-to-Clipboard Integration:

Copy CMD/PowerShell scripts and other relevant data directly using Copy Kits integrated with each viewable record.
This feature ensures rapid operator execution of scripts in external tools without in-app execution.
Manual Refresh for SharePoint Data:

Operators use manual refresh buttons to retrieve the latest updates from connected SharePoint sources and replace outdated entries.
This feature avoids automated flows and maintains controlled updates.
Urgency Indicators in Triage Dashboard:

Operators view indicators for stale or urgent issues (e.g., expired certifications or downed sites):
Cert Expired: Highlighted with red glow or urgency markers.
Site Down: Display status indicating critical scenarios requiring immediate action.
Administrator Flows
Administrators interact with the app using Edit Mode, allowing secure access for record management. Their workflow includes:

Toggle Secure Edit Mode:

Explicitly toggle into Edit Mode to modify records flagged as stale (e.g., update "Last Verified").
By default, administrators operate in read-only mode until switching to Edit Mode to prevent accidental edits.
Categorization with Pre-Defined Tags:

Manage data categorization by applying pre-defined tags, improving the efficiency and accuracy of operator searches.
Tags are structured based on operational attributes (e.g., tags for "urgent", "high-frequency").
Verify and Update Records:

Ensure all edits are manually verified and saved, maintaining data integrity for operators reliant on accurate information.
Update critical fields such as verification timestamps (Last Verified) or override stale entries flagged in the dashboard.
Manage CMD/PowerShell Scripts:

Administrators can organize scripts into distinct categories (e.g., troubleshooting, diagnostics) and specify shell types (CMD vs. PowerShell).
Scripts remain read-only for operators, with modifications limited to administrators in Edit Mode.
Workflow Enhancements
Operator Flow Clarity:

Define specific filters, tools (e.g., Copy Kits), and dashboard use cases for operational efficiency.
Reinforce manual-only updates and structured triage processes.
Administrator Control:

Secure editing workflow eliminates risks of unauthorized changes.
Data verification ensures continued reliability for operator use.
