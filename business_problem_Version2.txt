Business Problem

Operators require a centralized, read-only knowledge hub to triage operational issues quickly and efficiently. The app should address the following criteria:

Functional Requirements:

Data Centralization: Consolidate site information, contact data, troubleshooting guides, and command-line scripts into one unified interface.
Manual Refresh for Accuracy: Provide manual controls to refresh external data sources (e.g., SharePoint content, on-call exports) for ensuring up-to-date information.
Streamlined Access: Enable operators to easily search, filter, and retrieve records for rapid triage.
Operational Constraints:

Read-Only Mode: The app must default to read-only mode for operator use, preventing accidental data modification.
Secure Edit Mode: Administrators should be able to toggle into Edit Mode for verifying and updating stale or inaccurate records.
No Automated Workflows: The solution must avoid automation such as logging, flows, ticketing, or self-executing scripts.
UI Design and Usability:

Starship Cockpit Theme: A futuristic UI design based on a starship glass-cockpit aesthetic, reinforcing engagement and immersion.
Desktop-First Layout: Optimize for desktop usage, with fixed dimensions designed for 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080 resolution).
Specific Features:

Copy-to-Clipboard Functionality: Enable operators to manually copy CMD/PowerShell scripts or data directly from the app.
Urgency Indicators: Highlight stale or critical triage data visually (e.g., red glow for expired certifications).
Key Role Breakdown
Operators:

Access a clean, unified knowledge base containing filtered and categorized data.
Engage with troubleshooting guides, scripts, and contacts without modifying primary records.
Administrators:

Access Edit Mode for securely verifying and managing records.
Update stale entries using dedicated controls (e.g., Last Verified date).
