Hard Constraints

The following constraints are non-negotiable and must be adhered to in the application design and functionality:

1. No Automation or Workflows
The application must not include:
Automated Flows: No triggers to automatically update data based on external changes. All updates must require manual refresh actions by the user.
Logging: The app must avoid storing or tracking any user interactions or operational logs internally or externally.
Ticketing: No system for creating or managing tickets should be implemented within the app.
Runbooks or Automation Scripts: Any commands/scripts provided must be treated as static, read-only content. No automated executions are permitted.

2. Manual Refresh for Data Sources
Data synchronization with external sources (e.g., SharePoint content) must be explicitly controlled by users through manual refresh buttons.
No automated polling or periodic data refreshes are allowed. This ensures operators remain in control of when updates occur.

3. Desktop-First Layout
The application is intended for desktop use only and must follow the following layout specifications:
Fixed 16:9 aspect ratio design.
Optimize views for 1920x1080 resolution (1080p), ensuring visual consistency and usability across most standard desktop monitors.

4. CMD/PowerShell Scripts: Display-Only Mode
Scripts provided in the OpsCommands table must adhere to the following constraints:
Scripts are read-only and cannot be executed within the app.
Operators must be able to copy scripts via Copy-to-Clipboard functionality for manual use outside the app.

5. Read-Only Default with Explicit Edit Mode
All app users interact with the application in a read-only state by default.
Modification or editing of records is strictly limited to administrators and can only occur in an explicitly toggled Edit Mode.
Edit Mode must be disabled by default to prevent accidental data modifications.

6. Dataverse Table Support
The app must integrate and support the following three Dataverse tables, each serving specific functional purposes:
OpsKnowledgeHQ: Centralized repository for site information, phone contacts, nodes, troubleshooting guides, and references.
OpsOncallExports: Tracks and manages on-call schedules and roles. Includes bulk-update functionality via Excel import.
OpsCommands: Categorized repository of CMD/PowerShell scripts for manual troubleshooting and diagnostics.
