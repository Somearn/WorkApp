I want to create a PowerApp to be used by IT Opeartors that have a few menu items.

First is robust knowledge for each application and any notes or dependencies we might want to remember, including team members and phone numbers and supported applications.

Second is a page full of network Dianostic tools like ping host, nslookup, etc.

I would like to use Flow and PowerApps to build this.

Dark theme inspired by star trek.

Always be sure to follow security protocols and not do anything on the network that is unsecure.
