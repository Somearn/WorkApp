# WorkApp

A central hub for all my created applications and projects.

## Overview

This repository serves as a collection of various applications, utilities, and projects. Each application is organized in its own directory within the `apps/` folder.

The root directory also contains PowerShell-based modules (stored as `.txt` files) for the SomearnTK application suite.

## Structure

```
